# python_basic_game
A basic game devloped using Python
This code uses shuffle function from random. 
It then uses a function to assign the shuffled list to variable using return keyword. 
We then take the guess of the player by using input function defined in another function, in our case player_guess().
We then compare the position of the ball and the index number provided by player. 
These functions are called in a different function demonstrating interactions between different functions in Python. 
If it is a match we say it's a match or ask user to try luck in another attempt displaying the shuffled list.
